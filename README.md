# SkillBridge 🚀  
### Online Marketplace for Freelancers (Fiverr-like Platform)

SkillBridge is a full-stack MERN web application that connects **clients** and **freelancers** on a single platform.  
It allows freelancers to create and manage service gigs, clients to browse and purchase services, and both to communicate via real-time chat.  
An **admin panel** is included for platform monitoring and moderation.

This project is built as an **academic + real-world project**, demonstrating role-based systems, CRUD operations, dashboards, and real-time features.
